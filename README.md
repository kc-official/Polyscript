## One Script to Rule them All

PolyScript is a unified programming language that compiles into multiple other languages to build native apps across platforms, from a single codebase.

#### üß© File Extension: \*.psc (PolyScript Code)

### Concept

One Input. Multiple Outputs. Any Platform.
<br>
PolyScript eliminates the need to chose between multiple languages, environments, and frameworks by becoming the single point of truth across all app ecosystems.
PolyScript aims to unite developers from across all the various languages into a single force for innovation.
If you love your language, support it, by supporting PolyScript.
And if you haven't found a language you love... now you have!

### Core Philosophies

- Don't repeat yourself.
  <br>
- Write less. Deliver more.
  <br>
- Build once, test, and deliver.
  <br>
- Cross-Platform Code with Native Performance.
  <br>
- Let this be the death of platform-specific development.
